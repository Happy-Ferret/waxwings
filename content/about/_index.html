<p>Hi! Itâ€™s me, Mara (which I assume was readily apparent).</p>
<p>There are many things Iâ€™m good at, but writing about myself is <em>not</em> one of them. ðŸ˜•</p>
<p>Fortunately, the wild and wonderful internet lets me punt the questionâ€¦</p>
<p>Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/dataandme">@dataandme</a>, is probably the best place to go if youâ€™re looking to get info straight from the source (me). Thereâ€™s also that handy little sidebar with links to other sites. Oh, plus <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1923002-mara">my reading exploits</a> ðŸ“š over on Goodreads.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>ðŸ•µ Not sure itâ€™s really <em>the</em> Mara Averick? Take a gander at my <a href="https://keybase.io/maraaverick">keybase</a> page to put your mind at ease.</p>
