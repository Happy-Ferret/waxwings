If you’re on Windows, Microsoft Support has a little guide here: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system">Which Windows operating system am I running?</a>. If you’re running an open-source Linux distribution (or whatever), you’re way cooler than I am 😎, and I highly doubt you’ll need this guide.</p>
