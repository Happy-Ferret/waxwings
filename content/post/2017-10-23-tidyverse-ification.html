<p>In the weeks since Strategos Fleet Commander Hadley Wickham<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2017/09/14/rstudio-community/">announced</a> the 🆕 <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/">RStudio Community</a> site, its become a pretty happening place. 🤓</p>
<p>One benefit I didn’t expect, but absolutely love 😍 is the discovery of older resources that, despite not being hot off the presses, can still be incredibly useful.</p>

<p>This thread (🔗 above) was started by <a href="http://www.significantdigits.org/">Rajesh Korde</a>, who recently wrote a 🌟 <a href="http://www.significantdigits.org/2017/10/switching-from-base-r-to-tidyverse/">blog post</a> by the same name. The post gives what is, effectively, a translation table (see excerpt, below)</p>

<p>However, this wasn’t from the only useful post unearthed in this stream of Q&amp;A.</p>

<p>Recommended by <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/t/switching-from-base-r-to-tidyverse/1704/9?u=mara">Edward Visel</a>, Karl (an “early adopter,” and veteran user of both S and S-plus) describes this post as being:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…a tutorial for people like me, or people who were taught by people like me.</p>

<p>Written when <em>“dplyr [was] still in the early stages”</em>, Jim calls this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…a simple demonstration of how to convert existing plyr code to use the dplyr package.</p>

<p>I can’t get enough of the side-by-side layout 😻, so I think it’s worth ogling even if <code>ddply()</code> looks like nothing more than a simple typo to you.</p>

<h3><a href="https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/bk01_base-functions.html">purrr tutorial: Relationship to base and plyr functions</a> by Jenny Bryan</h3>
<p>I’m pretty obsessed with this entire <a href="https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/">purrr tutorial</a>, but this is a super-extra-special-awesome bit ⭐️! Seriously, as Jenny herself notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regardless of your preference [base or tidyverse], hopefully the side-by-side examples below are a helpful tour of different ways to iterate. Even if you prefer purrr/tidyverse in some settings, you might want base methods when you don’t want any dependencies.</p>

<p>That’s all for now. There’s lots more good stuff in the <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/c/tidyverse">tidyverse channel</a>, and on the <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/">RStudio Community</a> site as a whole. So, go check it out! If I messed anything up here, tweet 🐦  (<a href="https://twitter.com/dataandme">@dataandme</a>), or leave a comment.</p>
