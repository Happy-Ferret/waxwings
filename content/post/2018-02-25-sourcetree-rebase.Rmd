```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Ever the acolyte of Jenny Bryan when it comes to all things workflow, I try to
follow [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](http://happygitwithr.com/) as much as
possible.

I've never been especially _good_ at Git, per se, but [the shell](http://
happygitwithr.com/shell.html) met my needs for a long time...a long time, that
is, before I started working with a team that _really_ uses GitHub for version
control.

So, I decided to give [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) a whirl.
Though I'm definitely still wont to bork a repo now and again, I think the
experiment has largely been a success.

Since I'm still in the early-ish stages of getting into a rhythm, I figured I'd
write out the part that's been trickiest for me to grok â€” keeping forks in sync
with their "upstream" counterparts.

### The Setup

For getting a Git client set up, take a gander at the [**Install a Git client**](http://happygitwithr.com/git-client.html) section of Jenny's book. For
Sourcetree specifics, the documentation, ["Install and set up Sourcetree"](https://confluence.atlassian.com/get-started-with-sourcetree/install-and-set-up-sourcetree-847359043.html) really can't be beat.

OK, so now you've got some local repos connected to Sourcetree. It should look
something like this:

### Choose and open your project.

For this example, I was updating the [usethis](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis) package. 

You can change what branch you're on once you've opened up the repo's interface, but I _do_ want to point out that you can already tell I'm on _master_ from the index, since the name of the working branch is displayed on the right in the index.

To open that project, you simply double click the desired repo.

Once open, you can see where _your_ fork of the repo is (`origin/master`), and where _their_ repo is (`upstream/master`).

### Fetch from all remotes.

If you don't already have an "upstream" remote, you can set one up by clicking _New Remote..._ in the **Remotes** menu.

To sync things up, you'll want to fetch from all remotes.

### Merge and/or rebase the fetched commits.

After fetching, it's time to either `merge` or `rebase`, depending on your needs. There's a really nice explanation of the differences between the two in the [**Merging vs. Rebasing**](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing) tutorial by Atlassian, which I recommend checking out if these words are foreign to you.

In this case I want to rebase, but first I need to choose the proper branch from which to do so, which is `upstream/master`.

After selecting the right branch, you can go ahead and click **OK**.

### Push your changes to master.

When this has completed, your local working copy should be up-to-date with `upstream/master`. However, _your_ remote (`origin/master`) is still behind. This is because you have yet to push the changes.

After you click **Push**, double check that you are pushing to the correct fork and branch before clicking **OK**.

### And now you're synchronised! `r emo::ji("tada")`

If all went according to plan, your fork should now be caught up with upstream, in which case you're good to go!
