<p>The rumors are true 😱 <em>(ok, maybe there weren’t really any rumors)</em>, I’ll be speaking at the “Enterprise Applications of the R Language”, better known as <a href="https://earlconf.com/boston/">EARL, conference in Boston</a>. Technically, it’s a keynote (🗝📝). But, since I’ve never even given a <em>regular</em> note, I can’t really say whether or not there will be more 🔑s involved than usual.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Actual real adult data scientist, <a href="https://www.mango-solutions.com/blog/keynote-speaker-announcement-david-robinson-stack-overflow">David Robinson</a> (aka <a href="https://twitter.com/drob">@drob</a>) will also be keynoting,<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> which means you should totally go.</p>
<p>Since there are few things I loathe more than attempting to write about myself,<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> you should check out the announcement on the Mango blog for details: <a href="https://www.mango-solutions.com/blog/boston-earl-keynote-speaker-announcement-mara-averick"><strong>Boston EARL Keynote speaker announcement: Mara Averick</strong></a>.</p>

(It started out as <em>“Mara Averick was”</em>, but then the kind people of Twitter informed me that such a use of the past tense is best restricted to obituaries).<a href="#fnref3">↩</a></p></li>
