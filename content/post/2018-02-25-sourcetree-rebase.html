description: 'How to rebase your GitHub fork from upstream with fetch using Sourcetree. 🌲'
---



<p>Ever the acolyte of Jenny Bryan when it comes to all things workflow, I try to
follow <a href="http://happygitwithr.com/">Happy Git and GitHub for the useR</a> as much as
possible.</p>
<p>I’ve never been especially <em>good</em> at Git, per se, but <a href="http://%20happygitwithr.com/shell.html">the shell</a> met my needs for a long time…a long time, that
is, before I started working with a team that <em>really</em> uses GitHub for version
control.</p>
<p>So, I decided to give <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">Sourcetree</a> a whirl.
Though I’m definitely still wont to bork a repo now and again, I think the
experiment has largely been a success.</p>
<p>Since I’m still in the early-ish stages of getting into a rhythm, I figured I’d
write out the part that’s been trickiest for me to grok — keeping forks in sync
with their “upstream” counterparts.</p>
<div id="the-setup" class="section level3">
<h3>The Setup</h3>
<p>For getting a Git client set up, take a gander at the <a href="http://happygitwithr.com/git-client.html"><strong>Install a Git client</strong></a> section of Jenny’s book. For
Sourcetree specifics, the documentation, <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/get-started-with-sourcetree/install-and-set-up-sourcetree-847359043.html">“Install and set up Sourcetree”</a> really can’t be beat.</p>
<p>OK, so now you’ve got some local repos connected to Sourcetree. It should look
something like this:</p>

<div id="choose-and-open-your-project." class="section level3">
<h3>Choose and open your project.</h3>
<p>For this example, I was updating the <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/usethis">usethis</a> package.</p>
<p>You can change what branch you’re on once you’ve opened up the repo’s interface, but I <em>do</em> want to point out that you can already tell I’m on <em>master</em> from the index, since the name of the working branch is displayed on the right in the index.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/AAcWCeY.png" /></p>
<p>To open that project, you simply double click the desired repo.</p>
<p>Once open, you can see where <em>your</em> fork of the repo is (<code>origin/master</code>), and where <em>their</em> repo is (<code>upstream/master</code>).</p>

<div id="fetch-from-all-remotes.pull" class="section level3">
<h3>Fetch from all remotes.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></h3>
<p>If you don’t already have an “upstream” remote, you can set one up by clicking <em>New Remote…</em> in the <strong>Remotes</strong> menu.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/210s6wo.png" /></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/I5Gd5Vw.png" /></p>
<p>To sync things up, you’ll want to fetch from all remotes.</p>

</div>
<div id="merge-andor-rebase-the-fetched-commits." class="section level3">
<h3>Merge and/or rebase the fetched commits.</h3>
<p>After fetching, it’s time to either <code>merge</code> or <code>rebase</code>, depending on your needs. There’s a really nice explanation of the differences between the two in the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing"><strong>Merging vs. Rebasing</strong></a> tutorial by Atlassian, which I recommend checking out if these words are foreign to you.</p>
<p>In this case I want to rebase, but first I need to choose the proper branch from which to do so, which is <code>upstream/master</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/q5yi3kZ.png" /></p>
<p>After selecting the right branch, you can go ahead and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>

</div>
<div id="push-your-changes-to-master." class="section level3">
<h3>Push your changes to master.</h3>
<p>When this has completed, your local working copy should be up-to-date with <code>upstream/master</code>. However, <em>your</em> remote (<code>origin/master</code>) is still behind. This is because you have yet to push the changes.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Z6zimts.png" /></p>
<p>After you click <strong>Push</strong>, double check that you are pushing to the correct fork and branch before clicking <strong>OK</strong>.</p>

</div>
<div id="and-now-youre-synchronised" class="section level3">
<h3>And now you’re synchronised! 🎉</h3>
<p>If all went according to plan, your fork should now be caught up with upstream, in which case you’re good to go!</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<hr />
<ol>
<li id="fn1"><p><em>Jenny Bryan wisdom</em>: If you are on master locally <strong><em>and</em></strong> have not made any commits there that are unique to you, just pull master from upstream into it. That is the simplest. This reinforces/rewards the habit of never commiting directly to master on a repo that someone else largely controls. If you do that, you will always be able to pull straight into master. Then you can update your feature branches by merging master into them or rebasing them on master.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
