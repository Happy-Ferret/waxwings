<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jsonbecker/">Jason Becker</a>’s brilliant tweet 🐦 was born of a thread that began with <a href="https://twitter.com/kierisi/">Jesse Megan</a> reflecting on educational philosophies and trade-offs.</p>

<p>Jesse has been leading an <a href="https://medium.com/@kierisi/join-the-r-for-data-science-online-learning-community-842527222ab3">“R for Data Science” online learning community</a> (in its second week of operation, as of this writing). And, amid the R4DS-community activity, and Jason’s tweet, I got to thinking about the fact that this kind of expertise– the kind where you <em>know the words</em> to search for– is not, in fact, insubstantial.</p>
<p>Rather than opine on the nature of knowledge, allow me to offer a <em>“just so”</em> story of sorts about a time when <em>I</em> made a mistake that I couldn’t Google my way out of.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<h3>Mara makes a very stupid mistake</h3>
<p>Long long ago, when I was young and naïve,<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> I was trying to learn <em>something</em> on the computer that involved my using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagrant_(software)">Vagrant</a>, a virtual dev environment software. I wasn’t trying to do anything fancy; the goal was literally just to start running a Vagrant virtual machine, and then stop running it, but I hadn’t done <em>anything</em> at the command line for a very long time.</p>
<p>It all seemed so simple. To get going, I just needed to run <code>vagrant up</code> in the right directory. You can see what this should look like below:<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

</div>
<p>To <em>stop</em> the virtual environment, you run <code>vagrant halt</code>. Easy enough, right? <em>Well…</em></p>
<p>I could <strong>not</strong> get it to work. I read and re-read the documentation, looked at answers on StackOverflow, went through the whole <em>thing on a computer isn’t working right</em> routine many of us know so well. As it turned out, the problem was that I was trying to “halt” vagrant from <em>within</em> vagrant.</p>
<p>It’s a difficult thing to describe using words (<em>See? I’m circling back to my point!</em>), but I was, in effect, doing the vagrant-equivalent of trying to quit Microsoft Word by typing out the word <code>&quot;quit&quot;</code> (see visual aid below).</p>

<p>Of course, if this analogy had been apparent to me at the time, none of this would have occurred. That’s what makes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge">curse of knowledge</a> oh-so vexing: in order to <em>make</em> this analogy, you have to understand what’s going on, but it’s only <em>because</em> you <em>don’t</em> understand what’s going on that you need this analogy at all.</p>

<h3>Innocence lost</h3>
<p>I’ve been re-reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/840.The_Design_of_Everyday_Things"><strong>The Design of Everyday Things</strong></a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Norman">Donald A. Norman</a>, and I’ll close with a passage that I think captures the spirit of this quite well.</p>

<p>“Innocence lost is not easily regained. The designer simply cannot predict the problems people will have, the misinterpretations that will arise, the errors that will get made.” — Donald A. Norman, <em>The Design of Everyday Things</em></p>
