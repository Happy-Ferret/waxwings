### _Why show us the wrong way?_

I know, this seems like a perverse way of going aout things, but these are ways of getting information that will help others to help you. This means that there's a decent chance you're new to this whole endeavor, and may need some stop-gap, familiar methods before you begin to feel comfortable with best practices. 

There are good reasons to steer clear of your `r emo::ji_glue(":computer:")` mouse.[^workspace] Clicking is slow, and there are faster ways to retrieve this information using code. That said...

## _What version of RStudio am I using?_

From within RStudio go to the **Rstudio** menu and select **About RStudio**.

When the **About RStudio** window opens, the version of RStudio that you're using will be written right below the logo (see below).

## _What version of R am I using?_

Open RStudio and go to the **Console** pane. If you scroll up to the top, the version of **R** that you are using is in the very first line printed in your console.

## _What version of a package am I using?_

In the **Viewer** pane, click on the **Packages** tab. The packages you have loaded will have check marks to the left of their names, and, in the far right column, you'll see the package **versions**.

## _What mac OS am I on?_

From the apple icon in the upper-left corner of your screen, open **About This Mac**.

The version of your operating system (OS) will be listed right below its name (see below).

[^workspace]: See Jenny Bryan's ["R basics, workspace and working directory, RStudio projects"](http://stat545.com/block002_hello-r-workspace-wd-project.html) for some reasons why clicking around isn't the best way to go when it comes to reproducibility.
