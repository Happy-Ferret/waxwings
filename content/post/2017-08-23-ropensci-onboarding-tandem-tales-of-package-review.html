<p>On of the ways in which <a href="https://ropensci.org">rOpenSci</a> does such a stellar job of package <em>“quality control”</em> is through its open, peer-review <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding#ropensci-onboarding">onboarding</a> process.</p>
<p>I had the chance to take part in this by reviewing <a href="https://twitter.com/nj_tierney">Nicholas Tierney</a>’s awesome <a href="http://visdat.njtierney.com/"><code>visdat</code></a> package 📦.</p>
<p>In what I’m told is an rOpenSci first, Nick and I both wrote up our experiences for the <a href="https://ropensci.org/blog/">rOpenSci blog</a> — giving you a peek into the reviewer <em>and</em> reviewee process. So, go check them out!</p>
