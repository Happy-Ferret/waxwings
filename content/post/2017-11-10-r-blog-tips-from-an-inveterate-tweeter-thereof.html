<h3>Preemptive peccavi</h3>
<p>I am being selfish. The following items are tips, only insofar as they are to my liking. What’s more, the material isn’t even original. I wrote these up in response to a <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/t/tips-tricks-for-blogdown/2573?u=mara">thread</a> on the RStudio Community site.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> So, consider yourselves warned. ☠️</p>

<h3>1. Put a bird on it. 🐦</h3>
<p>Actually, not just a bird (<em>damn my dedication to TV show references</em>), I’d recommend having your twitter handle (if you’re on there) visible in writing. As someone who tweets posts that others write, it’s just <em>easier</em> if I can see the actual handle…yes, I <em>am</em> actually that lazy.</p>

<h3>2. Packages. 📦</h3>
<p>Even if you’re not writing a post <em>about</em> a particular package, it’s super helpful to see examples of how people are using a given package. Plus, this gives your post relevance beyond just the novelty of fresh material.</p>

<h3>3. Syntax highlighting! 🖍</h3>
<p>Just do it. Life is better when things are colourful. Plus, but it’s really not hard— I didn’t even have to do anything special with my blogdown theme to get it working. This is covered in the blogdown book<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> as both a <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/themes.html#the-default-theme">theme parameter</a> and a <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/templates.html#how-to">custom template</a>.</p>

<h3>4. Socialize. 👯</h3>
<p>Not as do or die, but, as you can see on forums, twitter, and elsewhere, getting the metadata right makes a big difference in terms of visual “browseability.” The how and why of this are well described 🙌 by Xavier (🐦 <a href="https://twitter.com/xvrdm">@xvrdm</a>) in his aptly-named post, <a href="https://xvrdm.github.io/2017/10/23/socialize-your-blogdown/"><strong>“Socialize your blogdown”</strong></a>. Heck, he even made the super cool graphic, below.</p>

<h3>🎉 Fin!</h3>
<p>There are definitely more tips out there (probably even some that <em>aren’t</em> just the product of one human’s idiosyncratic desires). No matter how niche your topic is, someone on the internet cares! There’s really no way to go wrong, though when comes to blogging what you’re learning, as it’ll help solidify things for <em>you</em>! <em>See?</em> Now you can be selfish too!</p>
