<p>When I found out that <a href="https://twitter.com/AmeliaMN">Amelia McNamara</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/AranLunzer">Aran Lunzer</a> were about to release their extremely awesome, <a href="http://tinlizzie.org/histograms/">interactive essay on histograms</a>, I was quick to offer my advice in my true area of expertise: making GIFs out of video for the internet. Amelia found my infinite wisdom to be helpful, and suggested that I do a blog post about it.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> And so, here we are‚Ä¶</p>

<p><strong>Big picture:</strong> I read a <a href="http://www.seascapemodels.org/rstats/2017/07/06/r-interactive-dataviz.html">cool post</a> by Christopher J. Brown (aka <span class="citation">[@bluecology]</span>(<a href="https://twitter.com/bluecology" class="uri">https://twitter.com/bluecology</a>)) which featured an interactive visualization.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> I wanted to share this post with my very closest friends (by which I mean Twitter), and capture the gist of it visually so they‚Äôd know whether to deem it click-worthy. Thus, I giffed (<em>not a real world, but it totally should be</em>) a few seconds of me playing around with the viz as tweetable enticement.</p>

<div id="step-0-getting-andor-making-a-video" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 0: Getting and/or making a video</h2>
<p>I made my giffing bones on the back of the talented folks who actually <em>make</em> Archer<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>, so this part isn‚Äôt exactly my bailiwick (usually I just have the video file).<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> I made this screen recording with <a href="https://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.html">Snagit</a>, which costs money. So you may want to look into other options. If you‚Äôre on a Mac/OS X, you can use <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2010/11/16/screen-recorder-mac/">QuickTime‚Äôs built-in functionality</a>, and I‚Äôm sure there are roughly a gillion other options out there. The point is: you need a video file.</p>
</div>
<div id="step-1-importing-video-frames-to-layers-in-photoshop" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 1: Importing video frames to layers in Photoshop</h2>
<div id="a.-set-up-photoshop" class="section level3">
<h3>a. Set up [photo]shop</h3>
<p>If it‚Äôs not self-evident, the first thing you should do is open Photoshop (PS). I have CS6, but, to my knowledge, this should work with CC. Because we‚Äôll be making an animation, I suggest you use the <code>Motion</code> workspace preset, which has the <code>Timeline</code> panel down at the bottom.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/fjfcNs0.gif" />

</div>
</div>
<div id="b.-import-video" class="section level3">
<h3>b. Import video</h3>
<p>Now that you‚Äôre in Photoshop go directly to <code>File &gt;&gt; Import &gt;&gt; Video Frames to Layers</code> (this will automatically generate a new file for you, so you don‚Äôt need to open or make a new file in advance).</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/h2n6yzS.png" />

</div>
<p>Once you find and select your video file, the <code>Import Video to Layers</code> dialogue box will open. Here you can select the part of the video you want to use. Even if you want the entire video, I highly recommend limiting the number of frames. If you do <em>not</em> limit the frames, it‚Äôs likely your file size will be <strong>huge</strong>!</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/qyo8DQX.gif" />

</div>
<p>As you can see, with this recording I limited to every 2 frames. However, the few times I‚Äôve made a screen recording with QuickTime, I‚Äôve limited to every 3 or 4 frames, depending on what I‚Äôm trying to capture.</p>
<p>Once you‚Äôve made your selections, you can go ahead and click <code>OK</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="step-2-editing" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 2: Editing</h2>
<div id="a.-delay-speed" class="section level3">
<h3>a. Delay (speed)</h3>
<p>The first few times I made GIFs in Photoshop, I couldn‚Äôt figure out why my results looked like they were on fast-forward. There didn‚Äôt appear to be a ‚Äúspeed‚Äù setting per se, so I had this whole convoluted process that involved making my GIF in PS, and then going to <a href="https://ezgif.com/speed">ezgif.com</a> to change the speed.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Turns out, the key(word) to my problem was <code>Delay</code>.</p>
<p>Though you <em>can</em> adjust the delay for individual frames (and I sometimes do), my default move is to select all of the frames (<code>Shift-Click</code>) and set the delay to 0.1 seconds using the triangular drop-down.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/UJYFPdh.png" />

</div>
<p>I almost always do this first because, among other things, it will make it much easier for you to catch any renegade frames if they‚Äôre not flashing by at the speed of light.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/DPpsWHl.gif" />

</div>
</div>
<div id="b.-other-stuff" class="section level3">
<h3>b. Other stuff</h3>
<p>Yes, this is a total cop-out, but the <em>‚Äúother stuff‚Äù</em> totally depends on what you‚Äôre doing. With screen recordings, I‚Äôm usually just cropping, but adding text, deleting unwanted frames, and the like all fall into this category.</p>
</div>
<div id="c.-optimize" class="section level3">
<h3>c. Optimize</h3>
<p>I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs an excellent explanation of what exactly happens when one uses the <code>Optimize Animation</code> feature in Photoshop out there somewhere, but this isn‚Äôt it. üò≥</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/ENnDtsP.png" />

</div>
<p>All I know is that by selecting all the frames (which I do using the same technique used for delay), clicking on <code>Optimize Animation</code>, and hitting <code>OK</code> with all the boxes ticked, I make my GIFs smaller (which is critical if you‚Äôre hoping to share them on Twitter and the like).</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/nq7vAFv.gif" />

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="step-3-saving" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 3: Saving</h2>
<div id="a.-save" class="section level3">
<h3>a. <code>Save</code></h3>
<p>I‚Äôm pretty sure I don‚Äôt need to explain this step. When you save, it will be a PSD file, which is nice to have in case you want to go back in and change something later. If I‚Äôve recorded something that isn‚Äôt my own (which is usually the case), I usually include the author‚Äôs Twitter handle in the file name, though there‚Äôs no profound rhyme or reason to do so.</p>
</div>
<div id="b.-save-for-web" class="section level3">
<h3>b. <code>Save for Web</code></h3>
<p>When you hit <code>Save for Web</code> the file type will default to whatever format you used the last time you saved something for the web in PS. In my case, this was already a GIF, but, if not, you can select a format from the drop-down (see below).</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/yj2CShH.gif" />

</div>
<p>This part involves quite a bit of playing around and seeing what happens. For me, there are two important ‚Äúoutcomes‚Äù I‚Äôm looking at:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How does my GIF look?<br />
</li>
<li>How big is the file?</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to not wanting to be a drag on the worldwide bandwidth usage, the <a href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/20156423">Twitter size and file type requirements</a> currently limit you to 15MB on the web, and 5MB on mobile. If you‚Äôre using a third-party app to post to Twitter, it‚Äôs likely even smaller.</p>
<div id="settings-to-play-with" class="section level4">
<h4>Settings to play with</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Size</strong>: You can (and maybe should) change this <em>before</em> you get to this step, but, if you haven‚Äôt, now‚Äôs another chance to do so. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs brilliant research out there suggesting ideal GIF dimensions for social media posting, but I usually do 640px width, or 500px if I‚Äôm having trouble getting the file size down.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></li>
<li><strong>Colours</strong>: Depending on what you‚Äôre working with, you may not actually need that many colours. I find that 128 works well for screen recordings, and <em>can</em> work well for more complicated, majestic animations, too (read: Archer GIFs).<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Dither</strong>: For a technical explanation, look elsewhere! My very non-technical explanation: 100% dither Archer GIFs (even if at 128, as opposed to 256 colours) can be massive files (~15MB). The dithering smooths out what almost look like contour lines of colour. When I <em>do</em> use dither (and I do, especially when it‚Äôs video footage, and I‚Äôve limited the number of frames involved) I usually go for the <code>Diffusion</code> setting.</li>
<li><strong>Lossy</strong>: Use this if you must. It can result in grainy-looking dots, but if you‚Äôve got a long GIF with many colours, and a lot of movement, you might have to go for it.</li>
</ul>
<div class="figure">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/3dbLv9N.png" />

</div>
<p>The beauty of using the 4-up view here is that you can literally look at the outcomes of setting adjustments side-by-side. If you want to adjust a particular frame (e.g.¬†see what 64 colours would look like with 100% dither), just select the panel you want, and adjust accordingly.Once you‚Äôve gotten a file you‚Äôre happy with ready to go, just make sure you have the panel you want to save selected when you hit <code>Save</code>.</p>

<div id="done" class="section level2">
<h2>Done üéâ</h2>
<p>Wow, you did it! I know, I know, this is a cursory overview at best, and done using <em>non</em>-open-source tools at that. However, these are the tools I have, and use, so: <code>¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø</code></p>
<p>If I got stuff wrong (which I‚Äôm sure I did, as I do so on the regular), feel free to angrily shake your fist at the sky, and/or contact me on Twitter @<a href="https://twitter.com/dataandme">dataandme</a>. The latter will likely be more effective, but far be it from me to tell you what to do.</p>
