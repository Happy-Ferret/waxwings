## Meta lessons learned

This is _not_ the post I originally intended to write about the [**rOpenSci Unconf**](http://unconf17.ropensci.org/) (and, I promise, this isn't just a lame attempt to take the Magritte joke a step further). Rather, what follows is wisdom gleaned in my (failed) attempts to write said original post capturing my unconf experience.[^1]
<!--more-->
In our two days of un-conferring, there were [**20 packages**](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/runconf17-projects/) written by ~70 [participants](http://unconf17.ropensci.org/#participants).[^2] So, how is it that almost _a month later_ I've been unable to produce a summary of/reflections on what went down? Well, I have some theories, and they have to do with the nature/organization of the unconf itself (something I've come to appreciate more and more with each passing day).[^3]

### I ❤️ deadlines?

Far-fetched though it may seem, a temporal constraint can be a beautiful thing. This is not to say that the packages produced won't require more work-- heck, [Julia Silge](https://twitter.com/juliasilge) and [David Robinson](https://twitter.com/drob)'s [tidytext](https://github.com/juliasilge/tidytext) was started at an unconf, and (amazing though they are) that was _not_ a two-day endeavor. However, having a firm stopping time made it clear that we'd have to clearly scope our work, and allow certain things to be left for later. 

Perhaps this comes naturally to some people. Alas, I am not one of them. Even ignoring the fact that my earlier unconf post drafts _had_ a bibliography, the amount of time I spent trying to deal with footnotes in sidenotes (see below) was ridiculous.
