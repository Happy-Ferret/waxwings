<div id="preamble" class="section level3">
<h3>Preamble</h3>
<p>Much of the code herein has been adapted from the excellent post <a href="http://giorasimchoni.com/2017/09/24/2017-09-24-where-my-girls-at/">‚ÄúWhere my girls at? Scraping Goodreads and using ML to estimate how many children‚Äôs books have a cetnral female character‚Äù</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/GioraSimchoni">Giora Simchoni</a>, which I highly recommend.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll also make reference to <a href="https://maraaverick.rbind.io/2017/08/goodreads-part-i-rgoodreads/">my earlier post</a> using my Goodreads data, should you want to check that out.</p>
<div id="why-arent-you-using-the-api" class="section level4">
<h4>üò± Why aren‚Äôt you using the API?!</h4>
<p><em>Calm down!</em> Yes, I know there is a perfectly lovely <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/api">Goodreads API</a>‚Äì and, by <em>‚Äúperfectly lovely‚Äù</em> I mean for getting pretty much any data <em>other</em> than book descriptions (which, as you will soon discover, are the objects of my desire).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="regular-amble" class="section level2">
<h2>Regular-amble</h2>
<p>When I came upon Giora‚Äôs post I experienced that weird sort of non-relief that occurs when you no longer have a good excuse to put off a project you‚Äôve been wanting to do, but have been too lazy to actually execute.</p>
<p>Giora uses a one two punch of the <a href="https://github.com/hadley/rvest"><code>rvest</code></a> and <a href="http://purrr.tidyverse.org/"><code>purrr</code></a> packages to scrape descriptions of children‚Äôs books included on a Goodreads list (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/226.Favorite_books_from_my_childhood">‚ÄúFavorite books from my childhood‚Äù</a>) and get them into tibbles. This is something I‚Äôve been threatening to do for my own collection of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1923002?shelf=read">read books</a> on Goodreads, so I figured an adaptation wouldn‚Äôt be too much trouble.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Since lists (the object of Giora‚Äôs analysis) and shelves are different (no one votes on whether or not a book should be on my <code>read</code> shelf‚Äî I either read it, or I didn‚Äôt, so <code>nVoters</code> wouldn‚Äôt be a variable for me), I expected there to be a few necessary changes in the code. However, I initially struggled more than I had expected‚Ä¶</p>
<div id="my-rookie-mistake" class="section level3">
<h3>My rookie mistake üò≥</h3>
<p>In many (most?) <code>rvest</code> tutorials, you‚Äôll learn about a Chrome bookmarklet called <a href="http://selectorgadget.com/"><strong>SelectorGadget</strong></a> (heck, it even has its own <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/vignettes/selectorgadget.html">eponymous vignette</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/hadleywickham">Hadley Wickham</a> in the <code>rvest</code> docs). It‚Äôs basically a tool that helps you identify the CSS or XPath selectors for finding certain elements of a webpage you‚Äôre trying to scrape.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Though I won‚Äôt give you a play-by-play of my fruitless attempts, it basically came down to the fact that I was trying to figure things out while <em>logged in</em> to my account.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Bo6sLIE.png" />
<br /></p>
<p>There <em>are</em> ways to scrape sites with R while logged in.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> However, it turned out that <em>not</em> being logged in was to my advantage as:</p>
<p><strong>1. There‚Äôs more data that shows up on the page when you‚Äôre not logged in</strong> (see below) and;<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yHxYZgl.png" />
<br /></p>
<p><strong>2. Pagination actually works the way it‚Äôs supposed to</strong> (which means you can get 30 entries at a time, rather than dealing with the annoying infinite-scroll interface over and over).</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/toPjFh8.png" />
<br /></p>
</div>
<div id="back-on-course-to-scrape" class="section level3">
<h3>Back on course to scrape üòå</h3>
<p>Once I got my selectorGadget situation sorted, the code was, as expected, easily adaptable. With the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/"><code>tidyverse</code></a>, <a href="http://stringr.tidyverse.org/"><code>stringr</code></a>, and <code>rvest</code> packages, I could construct a scraper, and clean some things up. Then, using <code>purrr</code>‚Äôs <code>map_dfr</code> bind the rows from each page together into a single data frame (or tibble, rather).</p>
<div id="oh-one-more-thing" class="section level4">
<h4>Oh, one more thing! ‚òùÔ∏è</h4>
<p>I also made a bit of a last-minute decision to scrape the <strong>GENRES</strong> from the book pages.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/yVwqduQ.png" />
<br /></p>
<p>Curating your own library (and its ‚Äúshelves‚Äù) is not as easy as one might think. In addition to the fact that my shelves are patently absurd (see <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1923002?shelf=codename-duchess"><strong>Codename Duchess</strong></a> for my Archer-related reviews, and or <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/1923002-mara?shelf=baby-shower-gift-guide"><strong>Baby Shower Gift Guide</strong></a> for books I think would make good baby shower gifts‚Äî y‚Äôknow, ones like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/723069879?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1">The Boys from Brazil</a>, and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/846607689?book_show_action=false&amp;from_review_page=1">The Midwich Cuckoos</a>) I don‚Äôt always know ahead of time that I will end up reading a shelf-worthy number of books about a given topic until after the fact.</p>

<div id="ok-now-we-can-rvest" class="section level3">
<h3>OK, <em>now</em> we can <code>rvest</code></h3>
<p>The code should be pretty self-explanatory. If you want to do this for your own books, you‚Äôd just switch out the <code>startURL</code> so that it points to <em>your</em> shelves, as opposed to mine.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>The top words make sense. I <em>do</em> read a lot of books about life, stories, the world, history, time, and people. The book descriptions often begin with editorial praise, e.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>From the New York Times best-selling author of‚Ä¶</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, it‚Äôs not surprising that words like ‚Äúbook‚Äù and ‚Äúauthor‚Äù would make it into the top ten, as well.</p>
<p>We could also look at these aggregates by word <em>stem</em>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tidy_book_word_stems &lt;- tidy_books %&gt;%
  count(word_stem, sort = TRUE)

tidy_book_word_stems</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 14,319 x 2

<p>Though the word stems themselves are not easy to read, we‚Äôve reduced the number of unique words by grouping together words with the same stem. There are 21172 unique words, and 14319 unique word stems. The counts for word stems are higher than for words, since multiple words have the same stems, e.g.¬†world and worlds, story and stories, etc.</p>

<div id="get_sentiments-with-afinn" class="section level4">
<h4><code>get_sentiments</code> üòº üò† üò≠ with AFINN</h4>
<p>I won‚Äôt go into the details here (for those, check out the <a href="http://tidytextmining.com/sentiment.html">Sentiment analysis with tidy data</a> section of Julia and David‚Äôs book), but let‚Äôs take a look at the sentiments associated with the words from my read book descriptions. I‚Äôll use the <code>AFINN</code> lexicon, which:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚Äú‚Ä¶assigns words with a score that runs between -5 and 5, with negative scores indicating negative sentiment and positive scores indicating positive sentiment‚Äù (Silge &amp; Robinson 2017, p.14)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is important to note, however, that this is a very much a subset of the words used in the book descriptions, and that the ‚Äúcensored‚Äù data may have a disproportionate impact in one direction or another.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data(sentiments)

word_sentiments &lt;- tidy_book_words %&gt;%
  inner_join(get_sentiments(&quot;afinn&quot;), by = &quot;word&quot;)

word_sentiments</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1,513 x 3
##    word         n score
##    &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;
##  1 war        454    -2
##  2 love       298     3
##  3 murder     234    -2
##  4 crime      221    -3
##  5 death      216    -2
##  6 true       202     2
##  7 powerful   181     2
##  8 dead       163    -3
##  9 winning    153     4
## 10 award      151     3
## # ... with 1,503 more rows</code></pre>
<p>I was a little surprised when I first saw some of these. For <code>kill</code> and <code>crime</code>, the AFINN score is -3, but <code>murder</code> is only a -2. The word <code>winning</code> merits a positive 4, but <code>war</code> only gets a negative 2!</p>
<p>You can learn more about AFINN <a href="http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=6010">here</a>, and I‚Äôm not knocking it. It‚Äôs not like <em>I‚Äôve</em> gone through 2,476 words and phrases and rated them for valence! However, it‚Äôs always good to look at your data and see what‚Äôs going on.</p>
<p>In fact, let‚Äôs take a look at all of the AFINN sentiment scores from the sentiments dataset.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(hrbrthemes)  # because I like pretty things

sentiments %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(score)) %&gt;%
  group_by(score) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(score)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = &quot;AFINN sentiment score distribution&quot;,
       xlab = &quot;AFINN score&quot;,
       ylab = &quot;count&quot;) +
  theme_ipsum_rc()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2017-10-17-goodreads-part-2_files/figure-html/afinn_sentiments-1.png" width="700" /></p>
<p>So, yeah, looks like there‚Äôs a whole lot of -2 going on. That‚Äôs not to say it‚Äôs incorrect‚Äî just worth noting out of curiosity.</p>
<p>Now let‚Äôs take a quick gander at the distribution of AFINN scores in the words that appeared both in the descriptions of the books I read, and in the AFINN lexicon. To be fair, we‚Äôre not really comparing üçès to üçés here. The AFINN Lexicon says nothing with respect to the frequency of the words it scores.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>word_sentiments %&gt;%
  group_by(score) %&gt;%
  summarise(score_tot = sum(n)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = score, y = score_tot)) +
  geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) +
