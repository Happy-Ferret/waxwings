A very silly bit of R fun, featuring `r emo::ji_glue(":package:")`: [tibbletime](https://business-science.github.io/tibbletime/), 
[tidyquant](https://business-science.github.io/tidyquant/index.html), and 
[magick](https://github.com/ropensci/magick) packages (as well as an awesome 
gif of MC Hammer by someone named bert).

The code itself (see [RPub here](http://rpubs.com/maraaverick/hammertibbletime)) 
is a  combination of [**Tidy time series Analysis with tibbletime**](http://www.business-science.io/code-tools/2017/10/26/demo_week_tibbletime.html) 
by [Matt Dancho](https://twitter.com/mdancho84), and [**How to Add a Logo to ggplot by Magick**](http://danielphadley.com/ggplot-Logo/) by 
[Daniel P. Hadley](https://twitter.com/danielphadley).
