description: '`r emo::ji_glue(":hammer:")``r emo::ji_glue(":alarm_clock:")` A mashup of a tibbletime tutorial with some [image]magickâ€¦ Beware, silly gifs on charts in store.'

A very silly bit of R fun, featuring `r emo::ji_glue(":package:")`: [tibbletime](https://business-science.github.io/tibbletime/), 
[tidyquant](https://business-science.github.io/tidyquant/index.html), and 
[magick](https://github.com/ropensci/magick) packages (as well as an awesome 
gif of MC Hammer by someone named bert).

The code itself (see [RPub here](http://rpubs.com/maraaverick/hammertibbletime)) 
is a  combination of [**Tidy time series Analysis with tibbletime**](http://www.business-science.io/code-tools/2017/10/26/demo_week_tibbletime.html) 
by [Matt Dancho](https://twitter.com/mdancho84), and [**How to Add a Logo to ggplot by Magick**](http://danielphadley.com/ggplot-Logo/) by 
[Daniel P. Hadley](https://twitter.com/danielphadley) (in which you'll learn how to make a very awesome Vincent-Vega version of an `mtcars` scatter-plot, below).

If you're not horrified by the affront to data visualization, you might also
enjoy the Archer-character charts I made based on Daniel's tutorial a few months
back (complete with code `r emo::ji_glue(":arrow_right:")` 
[Arch dossiers repo](https://github.com/batpigandme/arch_dossiers)).

Aww, heck, here's another!

### Now `r emo::ji_glue(":stop_sign:")` STOP: tibbletime
