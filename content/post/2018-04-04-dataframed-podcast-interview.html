description: 'üéôÔ∏è I had lots of fun talking to Hugo Bowne of DataCamp on their aptly-named podcast, DataFramed, Episode 16 ‚Äî Data Nerdism at Large.'
---



<p>In my personal going-on-a-podcast debut, I chatted with <a href="https://twitter.com/hugobowne">Hugo Bowne-Anderson</a> for the DataCamp podcast, <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast">DataFramed</a>. Hugo must be an amazing editor, because it even makes sense!</p>
<p>The episode, <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast/data-nerd">Data Nerdism at Large (with Mara Averick)</a>, is up on their site, along with links to some of the topics that came up. Since Hugo‚Äôs good at this stuff, I‚Äôll just steal his blurb:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mara Averick, self-labelled data nerd and Tidyverse developer advocate at RStudio, speaks with Hugo about all things data: what it means to be a data nerd and how data science impacts all of our lives from thinking about toxicology to sports analytics to data for social good and civic tech.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hard-hitting, super important mentions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 1976 Disney classic, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_ZHsk0-eF0">Donald in Mathemagic Land</a>;</li>
<li>Some great data-science-for-social-good organizations, such as <a href="https://www.drivendata.org/">DrivenData: Data science competitions to save the world</a>, and <a href="http://www.dataanalystsforsocialgood.com/">Data Analysts for Social Good</a>;</li>
<li>The prediction- and classifier-explaining package LIME (short for <a href="https://github.com/marcotcr/lime">Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, which, thanks to Thomas Lin Pedersen, also has an <a href="https://github.com/thomasp85/lime">R-package implementation</a>); and</li>
<li>Tamara Munzer‚Äôs excellent book, <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/vadbook/">Visualization Analysis and Design</a>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are probably others, but I‚Äôm pretty sure Hugo‚Äôs got them covered!</p>
