<p>I came upon a post by <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewheiss">Andrew Heiss</a>, <a href="https://www.andrewheiss.com/pelican/blog/2017/09/27/working-with-r-cairo-graphics-custom-fonts-and-ggplot/">Working with R, Cairo graphics, custom fonts, and ggplot</a>, and couldnâ€™t help but notice that the featured font was one Iâ€™d seen beforeâ€¦</p>

<p>I thought I could forget about itâ€” move on with my life. Maybe I could just load the tidyverse, recreate Andrewâ€™s plot, and be done with the whole thing.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)

# Create sample data
set.seed(1234)  # This makes R run the same random draw
df &lt;- data_frame(x = rnorm(100),
                 y = rnorm(100))

# Create plot
p &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = &quot;This is a title&quot;,
       subtitle = &quot;This is a subtitle&quot;) +
  annotate(&quot;text&quot;, x = 0, y = 0, label = &quot;This is some text&quot;,
           family = &quot;Papyrus&quot;, color = &quot;darkred&quot;, size = 8) +
  theme_light(base_family = &quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;)
p</code></pre>

<p>But noâ€” that was too easy. His font choice mocked me, still.</p>

<br /></p>
<p>So I did what I had to do. I pulled the <a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekly&amp;id=avatar.htm&amp;sort=weeknum&amp;order=ASC&amp;p=.htm">appropriate data</a> from <a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/">Box Office Mojo</a>, and made it all nice and R-friendly using Miles McBainâ€™s <a href="https://github.com/MilesMcBain/datapasta"><code>datapasta</code></a> package/add-in.</p>
