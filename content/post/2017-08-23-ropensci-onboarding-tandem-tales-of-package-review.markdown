On of the ways in which [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org) does such a stellar job of package _"quality control"_ is through its open, peer-review [onboarding](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding#ropensci-onboarding) process.

I had the chance to take part in this by reviewing [Nicholas Tierney](https://twitter.com/nj_tierney)'s awesome [`visdat`](http://visdat.njtierney.com/) package ðŸ“¦. 

In what I'm told is an rOpenSci first, Nick and I both wrote up our experiences for the [rOpenSci blog](https://ropensci.org/blog/) â€” giving you a peek into the reviewer _and_ reviewee process. So, go check them out!
