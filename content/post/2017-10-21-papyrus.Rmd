```

I came upon a post by [Andrew Heiss](https://twitter.com/andrewheiss), [Working with R, Cairo graphics, custom fonts, and ggplot](https://www.andrewheiss.com/pelican/blog/2017/09/27/working-with-r-cairo-graphics-custom-fonts-and-ggplot/), and couldn't help but notice that the featured font was one I'd seen before...

I thought I could forget about it— move on with my life. Maybe I could just load the tidyverse, recreate Andrew's plot, and be done with the whole thing.

```{r orig_plot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# Create sample data
set.seed(1234)  # This makes R run the same random draw
df <- data_frame(x = rnorm(100),
                 y = rnorm(100))

# Create plot
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "This is a title",
       subtitle = "This is a subtitle") +
  annotate("text", x = 0, y = 0, label = "This is some text",
           family = "Papyrus", color = "darkred", size = 8) +
  theme_light(base_family = "Comic Sans MS")
p
```

But no— that was too easy. His font choice mocked me, still.

So I did what I had to do. I pulled the [appropriate data](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekly&id=avatar.htm&sort=weeknum&order=ASC&p=.htm) from [Box Office Mojo](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/), and made it all nice and R-friendly using Miles McBain's [`datapasta`](https://github.com/MilesMcBain/datapasta) package/add-in.

```{r datapasta_tibble, include=FALSE}
data <- tibble::tribble(
