Regular Expressions, RegEx, regexps-- call them what you like, but no matter how you slice it, they're useful af. After all, data spelunking is all about patterns, and that's precisely what regexps are for: (wo)manhandling patterns in strings. Good Sirs Wickham and Grolemund, in their masterful tome, [r4ds](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/strings.html#matching-patterns-with-regular-expressions), describe them thusly:

 > They [regexps] take a little while to get your head around, but once you understand them, youâ€™ll find them extremely useful.[^r4dsregex]
 
There are helpful string-related R packages `r emo::ji("package")`, [`stringr`](http://stringr.tidyverse.org/) (which is built on top of the more comprehensive [`stringi`](https://github.com/gagolews/stringi) package) comes to mind. But, at some point in your computing life, you're gonna need to get down with regular expressions.

And so, here's a collection of some of the Regex-related links I've tweeted `r emo::ji("bird")`:
