[Jason Becker](https://twitter.com/jsonbecker/)'s brilliant tweet `r emo::ji("bird")` was born of a thread that began with [Jesse Megan](https://twitter.com/kierisi/) reflecting on educational philosophies and trade-offs.

Jesse has been leading an ["R for Data Science" online learning community](https://medium.com/@kierisi/join-the-r-for-data-science-online-learning-community-842527222ab3) (in its second week of operation, as of this writing). And, amid the R4DS-community activity, and Jason's tweet, I got to thinking about the fact that this kind of expertise-- the kind where you _know the words_ to search for-- is not, in fact, insubstantial.

Rather than opine on the nature of knowledge, allow me to offer a _"just so"_ story of sorts about a time when _I_ made a mistake that I couldn't Google my way out of.[^metoo]

### Mara makes a very stupid mistake

Long long ago, when I was young and naïve,[^vagrant] I was trying to learn _something_ on the computer that involved my using [Vagrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagrant_(software)), a virtual dev environment software. I wasn't trying to do anything fancy; the goal was literally just to start running a Vagrant virtual machine, and then stop running it, but I hadn't done _anything_ at the command line for a very long time.

It all seemed so simple. To get going, I just needed to run `vagrant up` in the right directory. You can see what this should look like below:[^mrpradp]

To _stop_ the virtual environment, you run `vagrant halt`. Easy enough, right? _Well..._ 

I could **not** get it to work. I read and re-read the documentation, looked at answers on StackOverflow, went through the whole _thing on a computer isn't working right_ routine many of us know so well. As it turned out, the problem was that I was trying to "halt" vagrant from _within_ vagrant.

It's a difficult thing to describe using words (_See? I'm circling back to my point!_), but I was, in effect, doing the vagrant-equivalent of trying to quit Microsoft Word by typing out the word `"quit"` (see visual aid below).

Of course, if this analogy had been apparent to me at the time, none of this would have occurred. That's what makes the [curse of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge) oh-so vexing: in order to _make_ this analogy, you have to understand what's going on, but it's only _because_ you _don't_ understand what's going on that you need this analogy at all.

### Innocence lost

I've been re-reading [**The Design of Everyday Things**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/840.The_Design_of_Everyday_Things) by [Donald A. Norman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Norman), and I'll close with a passage that I think captures the spirit of this quite well.

> "Innocence lost is not easily regained. The designer simply cannot predict the problems people will have, the misinterpretations that will arise, the errors that will get made." — Donald A. Norman, _The Design of Everyday Things_

[^metoo]: _I know_, it's hard for me to imagine my making a mistake too. But, I swear, it really did happen. `r emo::ji("flushed")`

[^vagrant]: OK, not that long ago. The story involves [Vagrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagrant_(software)), which has, evidently, only existed since 2010.

[^mrpradp]: This story takes place two laptops ago, so the image you're seeing is not mine! It's from ["Pivotal Cloud Foundry Laptop"](https://medium.com/code-tech/pivotal-cloud-foundry-in-laptop-5e5add6ef1e9) by Pradeep S ([\@mrpradp](https://twitter.com/mrpradp) on twitter).
