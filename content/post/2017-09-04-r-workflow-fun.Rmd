I was excited to see [**Declutter your R workflow with tidy tools**](https://peerj.com/preprints/3180/)[^RossWickhamRobinson], a preprint by Zev Ross, Hadley Wickham, and David Robinson, among the many excellent paper's in the [_Practical Data Science for Stats_](https://peerj.com/collections/50-practicaldatascistats/) PeerJ collection.[^1] Workflows, whether data-analysis-related or not, are never a one-size-fits-all matter of course. That said, there's lots to be learned from the mistakes and successes of others. So, here's a roundup of some of the workflow posts that have piqued my interest over the past year or so.[^2]

[^1]: There are a lot of great resources in there, so I highly recommend giving them a read, or at least a skim, if you're truly pressed for time.

[^2]: So, really, just `workflow` related tweets from üê¶ [\@dataandme](https://twitter.com/dataandme) put here in a somewhat less ephemeral medium.
